<h1>Bugs</h1>

<p>B7 df_fwhm1d crashes matlab when the input contains nan values</p>

<p>B6 In setUserDotsDNA when dots have the same x,y, different z. It
is impossible to select/deselect one of them. Possible solution: when
in non-projected mode only show dots at current plane. Or show a list
of nearby dots when there is an ambiguity.</p>

<h1>Closed</h1>

<p>B5 20170927, df_com3 not compiling on Eleni&rsquo;s computer. (solution:
install pkg-config using brew)</p>

<p>B4 2017-09-27. ~/matlab/startup.m not run on Eleni&rsquo;s computer by
default. (solution: start matlab from terminal)</p>

<p>B3 2017-09-27. Closed, Could not be recreated. Possibly fixed. AM: I am having a problem with Dotter while selecting the dots in the nuclei for DNA FISH. In some channels I selected the dots and when I moved to the next channel or nuclei, the previous dots selected were &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo;. This doesn&rsquo;t happen everytime but in random images. Did this happen any other time before?
  Source of the problem <code>setUserDotsDNA.m</code>, most likely in <code>gui_dotClick</code>.</p>

<p>B2 2017-09-04, could not be recreated. Bug: When exporting userDots, multiple values for fwhm and value. Reported 2017-08-30.</p>

<p>B1 2017-09-04, fix in <code>get_nuclei_dapi_ui()/setZauto()</code> Bug: The upper z-limit in the cell-segmentation seems to be stuck, i.e.,
   not changing intelligently. Reported 2017-08-29.</p>
